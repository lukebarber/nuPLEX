What is nuPLEX?
===============
nuPLEX is an application for Roku media streaming devices and the NowTV media streaming device. Built on the foundation of the original PLEX for Roku client, nuPLEX offers increased functionality and an entirely new user interface built from the ground up.

Why a new user interface?
==============================
Since the original PLEX for Roku client launched the majority of complaints have come from users who were dissapointed in or found the existing interface clunky and 'ugly'. That's because it uses some of the Roku's standard SDK screens and views which made development easier; however wanting to show off my media library to friends and family I came up with an entirely new interface and worked hard to bring it to realisation.

What devices are compatible?
============================
nuPLEX is complatible with all of the following devices, though installation methods may vary.

- Roku HD (N1100, N1101, 2000, 2500)
- Roku 2 XD (2050, 3050)
- Roku 2 XS (3100)
- Roku LT (2700)
- Roku 1 (2710)
- Roku 2 (2720)
- Roku 3 (4200)
- Sky NowTV (1st Gen)

nuPLEX is NOT compabiel with the Roku SD (N1050) or the Roku DVP (N1000) - Sorry!
